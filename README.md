## About

I am a Master’s student in Electrical and Computer Engineering (Machine Learning) at  
Rutgers University – New Brunswick. I work at the intersection of real-time graphics,  
GPU task scheduling, and VR / AR systems.

Most of my current work lives inside LAGEngine, my custom C++ / OpenGL / CUDA engine  
that doubles as a research testbed for:

- DAG-based render graphs with explicit passes and resources  
- Multithreaded work-stealing schedulers  
- CUDA–OpenGL interoperability for direct writes into graphics buffers and textures  
- GPU stream and utilization tuning for real-time scenes  

I care about systems that ship, can be profiled, and can be improved with real numbers.

## Active Runs (Selected Projects)

### LAGEngine – C++ / OpenGL / CUDA engine and research platform

- Custom 2D / 3D game and physics engine used as the base for my master’s thesis.  
- Implements a DAG-aware render graph with explicit passes and resources.  
- Uses multithreaded scheduling and CUDA–OpenGL interop so GPU kernels can write directly  
  into graphics buffers and textures.  
- Instrumented for frame timings, queue depths, synchronization costs, and GPU utilization  
  to compare scheduling policies honestly.

Repository: [LAGEngine](https://github.com/satrajitghosh183/LAGEngine)

### VR / AR systems

- VR fitness and exercise game built as a six-month project that placed third in the  
  Google and GeeksforGeeks “Solving for India” competition (gamified workouts with  
  deep-learning-based tracking).  
- VR warehouse training: industrial warehouse reconstructed in VR with annotation and  
  learning modules for step-by-step operator training.  
- VR house tours for an architecture use case: interactive VR walkthroughs so clients  
  can experience designs before construction.  
- VR movie theatre experiences: VR environments and mini-games built for entertainment  
  during and after lockdown.

This line of work led to a VR-related publication and multiple VR hackathon wins.

### Neural rendering and 3D vision (Princeton exchange)

Through a competitive exchange program at Princeton University I have worked on:

- Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) for photorealistic 3D scenes from multi-view images  
- Gaussian Splatting for real-time point-based rendering of dynamic scenes  
- Neural scene reconstruction and neural character generation pipelines for  
  animatable 3D avatars from unstructured images  

---

### Multimodal and quantitative side projects

- McGurk effect experiments on deep models: pipelines to test how models handle  
  conflicting audio–visual speech cues, with custom evaluation scripts and visualizations.  
- Quantitative tooling: engines and scripts for signal generation, backtesting, and  
  workflow automation around trading and data analysis.
